PoreSizeExcel

This is an ImageJ plugin providing two indepedent, but interconnected functionalities: 

1) The possibility to run macros from an Excel file to automatize image treatment on large batches

2) An interface to Beat Muench's xlib plugin allowing to do serial pore size estimation using the Excel macro reading functionality.

To install this plugin, downlaod the latest binary release (.jar file), at present at 
https://github.com/tbgitoo/PoreSizeExcel/releases/download/v0.9/PoreSizeExcel_.jar
Place the PoreSizeExcel_.jar file in the "plugins" folder of your Fiji or ImageJ installation.

If you want to use the Excel macro running capacity only, then the 
following .jar files should additionally be placed in your ImageJ or Fiji installation 
(in the jars folder):
A) "poi-3.17.jar" or higher: Java-Excel interface, Apache library, from 
    https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.poi/poi
B) "poi-ooxml-3.17.jar" or higher: Java-Excel interface, Apache library, from 
	https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.poi/poi-ooxml
C) "poi-ooxml-schemas-3.17.jar" or higher: Java-Excel interface, Apache library, from 
	https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.poi/poi-ooxml-schemas
D)  "jama-1.0.3.jar": Generic Java math library, from 
	https://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama
In many cases you will already have some or all these files due to the installation of other plugins, but please check and if 
necesary complete.

With these dependencies satisfied, you should be able to see the plugin in the ImageJ menu hierarchy after restart. In the 
"Plugins" menu, you should see an entry "Microniche PoreSize Excel". Of these, the generic and Excel-related functionality should
already work, that is the submenu entries "Batch Process with Excel File", 
"PoreSizeExcel_.jar Version", "Dependencies", and "Credits".


Concerning the pore size measurement, Beat Muench (EMPA, Switzerland) has developped a great ImageJ
plugin that among many other things fits maximal spheres into the pore space to get a continuous pore size distribution. This
plugin is term xlib, described at https://imagej.github.io/User_Xlib and available for 
download at https://sites.imagej.net/Xlib/plugins/

To satisfy the dependency of this plugin, get the most recent xlib_.jar version from https://sites.imagej.net/Xlib/plugins/ 
and place it in the "plugins" folder of your ImageJ or Fiji installation. It might be necessary to remove the version number
from the filename as at least some ImageJ installations do not recognize the xlib_.jar1234 type of file names as Java files.
After restart of ImageJ, you should see a point "Beat" in the Plugins menu
 
Here, we provide a small wrapper around the maximal sphere facility that directly allows to set the
correct scale from the image information, get tabulated results and automatically close the 
intermediate windows. This enables automation along with the Excel macro reading capacity, 
otherwise this needs to be done manually (from Plugins > Beat > Pore Size Distribution). 

This part of the plugin is available through
"Plugins > Microniche PoreSizeExcel > xlib Pore Size Distribution". It is independent of the Excel macro part in the 
sense that it can be used on an open gray scale image on its own, but compatible 
since it can be run compactly by a macro.

We further used the Java least squares fitting library by Matthew B. Smith 
(http://orangepalantir.org; https://github.com/odinsbane/least-squares-in-java/). 
This part is integrated into the jar, and so nothing needs to be done to satisfy the dependency, we however
acknowledge here the great work that Matthew B. Smith has put into this.
